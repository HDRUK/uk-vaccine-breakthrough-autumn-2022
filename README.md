# Risk of Severe COVID-19 Outcomes After Autumn 2022 COVID-19 Booster Vaccinations


## Overview

We conducted a prospective, multi-nation, observational cohort study of adults residing in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, who had received an autumn 2022 COVID-19 booster vaccination between September 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Statistical analyses were conducted on the risk of a severe COVID-19 outcome; hospital admissions or deaths *caused* by COVID-19.

## Analysis code

We use this repo to host the code used to carry out the statistical analyses within each nation's Trusted Research Environments (TREs), as well as the meta-analysis code written to combine the results.

Versions of R and the packages used where:

- England: R v4.1.2, survival v3.5-5 
- Northern Ireland: R v4.1.3, survival v3.3-1 
- Scotland: R v4.1.2, survival v3.2-15
- Wales: R v4.1.2, survival v3.5-5 
- Meta-analysis: R v4.2.2, metafor v3.8-1
